# Interview Task - Buro Happold KTP Associate Vacancy

## Task Description

We would like you to undertake an object detection task using this dataset. The dataset is a floorplan dataset which includes three classes: rooms, windows, and doors (classes file is located in the labels folder). You may split the dataset provided into training and testing sets.

We would like you to think about how you can use the dataset to implement/train an ANN to detect elements from the floor plan, with reference to the labels present in the provided dataset.

Please write your solution using Python and a ML framework of your choice. Before starting the work, please set up a private repository where you will commit your solution, making sure to make progressive commits as you work (i.e. don’t commit all at once) with descriptive comments (both in the code and for your commits) whenever possible.

When done, please also prepare a short presentation to explain the work you’ve done.

Your solution doesn’t have to be perfect, but you should identify possible improvements that can be done.

## Criteria

We will look at the following aspects of the work:

- How the model performs
- How you judge the performance
- General code quality, code clarity, and commit history
- The clarity of your final presentation and the way you present it during the interview.
